## 📂 Directory structure

Familiar React application structure, just with `electron` folder on the top :wink:  
*Files in this folder will be separated from your React application and built into `dist/electron`*  

```tree

│   ├── main                  Main-process source code

## 🚨 Be aware

This template integrates Node.js API to the renderer process by default. If you want to follow **Electron Security Concerns** you might want to disable this feature. You will have to expose needed API by yourself.  

To get started, remove the option as shown below. This will [modify the Vite configuration and disable this feature](https://github.com/electron-vite/vite-plugin-electron/tree/main/packages/electron-renderer#config-presets-opinionated).

```diff
# vite.config.ts

electron({
- renderer: {}
})
```
